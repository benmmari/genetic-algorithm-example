# genetic-algorithm-example

How To Run:

ruby main.rb {population capacity} {initial population size} {the solution} {no. of generations to print}

i.e ruby main.rb 100 10 RANDOM 4

NB: The chromosome size of the organism needs to be an even number, so the length of the solution must be an even number

## Definitions  
P - population capacity - the maximum capacity of the population  
I - initial population size - how many organisms in the first generation  
S - the solution - the solution that will yield the maximum fitness  
N - no. of generations to print - when the simulations comes to an end it will print the solution and it's lineage up for N generations
